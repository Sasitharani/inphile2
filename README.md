# This is a project for insphile with black background
For the service view:
1) Create six divs.
2) Arrange three divs at the top and three at the bottom.
3) Apply a 2x rounded border to each div.
4) Place the divs to fill in the parent div.
5) Divide each div into two parts:
   - The top part will be the title.
   - The bottom part will be the content.
6) The title will be bold.
7) The text will be black.
8) The background will be gray and slightly transparent.
9) When hovering over the div, the background will change to blue-500.
10) When the service view is landed from the link (it will be scrolled), it should animate as if it is coming from the bottom of the parent div to the parent of the parent div.
